    "#### Project Overview\n",
    "This project is an option pricing calculator that implements three different pricing models: Black-Scholes, Binomial Option Pricing, and Monte Carlo simulation. The project is designed to calculate the prices of both call and put options for a given stock, using real-time market data."

    "#### Project Structure\n",
    "The project consists of three main Python files:\n",
    "1. `data_utils.py`: Handles data retrieval and processing\n",
    "2. `pricing_models.py`: Contains the implementation of the three pricing models\n",
    "3. `main.py`: Orchestrates the overall execution of the program"

    "#### Key Features\n",
    "1. Real-time Data Retrieval: The project uses the yfinance library to fetch current stock prices, risk-free rates, and historical data for volatility calculations.\n",
    "2. Multiple Pricing Models: Three different option pricing models are implemented, allowing for comparison and analysis:\n",
    "    - Black-Scholes Model\n",
    "    - Binomial Option Pricing Model\n",
    "    - Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "3. Flexibility: The program can price both call and put options.\n",
    "User Input: The main script allows for user input of the stock ticker, strike price, and expiration date."

    "#### Detailed Workflow\n",
    "1. Data Retrieval (data_utils.py):\n",
    "    - Fetches the current stock price for the specified ticker\n",
    "    - Calculates time to maturity based on the current date and option expiration date\n",
    "    - Retrieves the current risk-free rate (using 1-year Treasury yield as a proxy)\n",
    "    - Calculates historical volatility based on past stock price data\n",
    "2. Option Pricing (pricing_models.py):\n",
    "    - Implements the Black-Scholes formula for European options\n",
    "    - Provides a binomial tree model for option pricing\n",
    "    - Uses Monte Carlo simulation for option valuation\n",
    "3. Execution (main.py):\n",
    "    - Prompts the user for input (stock ticker, strike price, expiration date)\n",
    "    - Retrieves necessary market data\n",
    "    - Calculates option prices using all three models\n",
    "    - Displays the results"
